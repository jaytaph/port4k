id: hallway_1
name: Reinforced Hallway
short: "A narrow corridor with ribbed plating and emergency beacons."
description: |
  The corridor runs east–west with ribbed deck plating underfoot. Emergency beacons strobe a dull red,
  throwing staccato shadows between support struts. The air smells faintly of burnt insulation.

  Overhead, a {o:power_conduit} snakes along the ceiling, its casing cracked. On the eastern bulkhead,
  a recessed {o:access_panel} sits beside a hardened {o:east_door}. To the west, the passage opens
  toward dim observation ports. The way back {o:south_exit} leads to the Entry Hall.
hints:
  - "The power conduit looks damaged—try repairing it with proper tools."
  - "If the corridor has power, access panels may accept diagnostics probes."
  - "A hardened east door likely ties into the access panel's security relays."
  - "Emergency beacons suggest the main grid is offline or bypassed."
  - "If you found tools in the previous room, they might help here."
