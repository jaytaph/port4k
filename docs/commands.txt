Core (everyone)

Movement: n s e w u d (aliases: north etc.), go <dir>

Look: look (room), look <thing|dir>, exits (compact list)

Examine: examine <item|npc>, read <sign|book>

Interaction: open/close <door|container>, lock/unlock <door> [with <key>], push/pull/press/use <object>

Inventory: inventory|inv, get <item> [from <container>], drop <item>, put <item> in <container>, wear/wield/remove <item>, eat/drink <item>

Communication: say <msg>, emote <action>, whisper <player> <msg>, shout <msg>

Player info: score, xp, skills, quests, who, time

Meta: help [topic], commands, repeat (repeat last), alias <short> = <long>, history

Optional (combat module)

Targets: consider <mob>, scan

Actions: attack <mob>, flee, cast <spell> [at <target>], use <skill> [on <target>]

Combat items: reload, fire, throw <item> at <target>

Status: hp|mana|stamina, party, invite <player>, kick <player>

Puzzle/Quest hooks (Lua-friendly verbs)

use <thing> on <thing>, combine <a> with <b>, place <item> on <pedestal>, set <code|dial> to <value>, say <keyword>
(Reserve these so room scripts can intercept cleanly.)

Social / Economy

Trade: offer <player> <item|coins>, accept, decline, trade <npc>

Money: coins, pay <npc> <amount>, deposit/withdraw <amount>

Group: follow <player>, unfollow, lead

Navigation Quality-of-Life

Pathing: map (ascii mini-map), where, path <dest> (if you add pathfinding)

One-way awareness: peek <dir> (shows dest title if exit unlocked/visible)

Building / Moderation (your system)

Blueprints:

@bp new <bp> "Title"

@bp room add <bp>:<room> "Title" "Body"

@bp exit add <bp>:<from> <dir> <bp>:<to> [locked]

@bp exit lock <bp>:<from> <dir> / @bp exit unlock …

@bp room lockdown <bp>:<room> / @bp room open <bp>:<room>

@bp entry <bp>:<room>

@bp submit <bp>

Playtest:

@playtest enter <bp> [<room>]

@playtest leave

@playtest reload (reload Lua)

Content tools:

@set <bp>:<room> <field> <value> (title/body/tags)

@exit set <bp>:<from> <dir> <field> <value> (desc/locked/visible)

@lint <bp> (basic validation)

@bp ls [<bp>], @bp show <bp>:<room>, @bp del <bp>:<room|exit>

Admin (ops)

@where <player>, @teleport <player> <bp>:<room>

@grant <player> <perm>, @revoke <player> <perm>

@spawn <npc|item> [into <bp>:<room>]

@shutdown, @announce <msg>

Parsing & UX conventions (keeps it snappy)

Abbreviations: first letter for movement, inv, exa, em, hp.

Quoted args: keep your split_args_quoted behavior (supports multi-word titles/bodies).

Aliases: built-in aliases table + per-player alias.

Unknown verbs: in playtest → forward to room Lua; in live → standard “unknown command”.

Minimal “must-haves” to start

n s e w u d, look, examine, exits, get/drop/put, inventory, open/close, use, say, help, plus your @bp set and exit lock/room lockdown.

If you want, I can generate the command router skeleton (Rust enums + dispatcher + Lua hook points) with these verbs pre-wired and stubs for you to fill in.
